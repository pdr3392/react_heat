# react_heat

A React project built for Rocketseat's Next Level Week Heat. Used Vite, Github for sign-in, axios to fetch data from Back-End, SASS for styling and Socket-IO for users' session.

To run it clone the project with "git clone git@github.com:pdr3392/react_heat.git", install the dependencies with* "yarn install" and run the project with* "yarn dev".

This project's layout was built from scratch with Ignite's trainer (Diego Fernandes, https://github.com/diego3g). (*You can also use "npm" or "npx".)
